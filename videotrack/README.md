# VideoTrack (mod_videotrack)

**VideoTrack** is a custom Moodle activity module designed to embed videos and accurately track students' viewing progress. It allows teachers to condition activity completion on students watching a minimum percentage of the video, ensuring complete engagement with the educational content.

## Key Features

*   **Flexible Video Sources**: Supports embedding videos via external links (including YouTube, YouTube Shorts, and other direct URLs), as well as direct MP4 file uploads.
*   **Real-Time Progress Tracking**: Automatically monitors and records the student's highest video playback position in real time.
*   **Playback Control (No Forwarding)**: Prevents students from fast-forwarding or skipping ahead through parts of the video they have not yet watched.
*   **Target-Based Completion**: Set a custom completion threshold (e.g., 80%) where the activity is automatically marked as completed once reached. Setting the target to `0` enables free viewing with unrestricted navigation.
*   **Detailed Progress Reports**: Provides teachers with a comprehensive dashboard showing each student's highest playback percentage and current activity completion status.
